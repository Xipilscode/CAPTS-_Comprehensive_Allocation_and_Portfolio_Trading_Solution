# Capital_Allocation_Optimization

# Project Title

The project is aimed at providing users with a reliable tool to make informed investment decisions across 3 asset classes (crypto, commodities, and stocks). The first step involves collecting and cleansing data from financial APIs, such as Yahoo finance, using Pandas. Once the data is cleaned, Monte Carlo simulation is employed to analyze it and calculate essential metrics, such as returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio, for each asset class.

The simulation generates arrays of portfolios for each asset class with asset allocations, which the user can select from. Two optimal portfolios are identified for each asset class: one with the maximum Sharpe ratio, offering higher returns but also higher risk, and the other with minimum volatility, offering greater stability, but lower returns.

After selecting the preferred portfolio, the project runs a second layer of Monte Carlo simulation to determine the asset allocation for each asset class. This enables users to make informed investment decisions based on their risk tolerance and investment goals.

Overall, the project provides a comprehensive, data-driven approach to investment decision-making that empowers users to make informed choices based on actual data, instead of relying solely on gut feelings or traditional financial advice.

## Instructions

User will be prompted to input the amount of capital to invest, once entered press "Enter". Next the user will be prompted to input how many years they would like their analysis to cover, once entered, press "Enter". User will then be provided with Returns, Volatility, Sharpe ratios, and potfolio weight distribution for three asset classes: Crypto, Stocks, and Commodities. The user will also be shown visualizations illustrating max & min volatility on scatter plots which show projected Portfolio returns against risk. Thus user can then use this model to decide how much money they would like to invest based on the information provided.
